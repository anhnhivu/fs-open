# Part 1

### Course information

**1.1.** Refactor the code so that it contains three components, instead of one.

**1.2.** Refactor the *Content* component.

- Create the application

``` shell
$ npx create-react-app courseinfo
$ cd courseinfo
$ npm start
```

- Modify `index.js` and `App.js`.
- `App.js` defines a React component within *App*, the root component.
- The layout of React components is written in **JSX**. Although it looks like HTML, it will be compiled into Javascript.
- Compose applications from many specialized reusable components. 
- Props: passing data to components
- The component name must be capitalized.
